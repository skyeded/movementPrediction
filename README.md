## Predict the the future movement of human

Using GAN or Generative Adversarial Network?

### Tesla's Auto Pilot prediction uses movement prediction (?)

**AI Algorithms used**: cNN, rNN and reinforced learning.

_The system utilizes a combination of cameras, radar, and ultrasonic sensors to analyze the car's surroundings and respond to new situations on the road. Machine learning algorithms are used to recognize patterns in the data gathered by these sensors, which are then used to make decisions about how the car should respond to changing conditions._

***If the car detects a pedestrian crossing the road, the algorithms can analyze the movement patterns of the pedestrian and predict their future trajectory. This allows the car to adjust its speed and path to avoid a collision. As more data is collected, the system becomes better at recognizing and responding to different types of situations (Reinforcement learning), ultimately improving the overall safety and performance of the car.***

## Basic idea

Data: Skeletal points of before surgery and after surgery.

The input (Skeletal points before surgery) and output (Skeleta points after surgery) will be trained in the model (still unknown). 

# New input

New data can be added and reinforced learning can be applied to improve the accuracy of the model.
