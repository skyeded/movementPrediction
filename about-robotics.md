## Robotics - Fundamentals

**SENSE -> THINK -> ACT**
- `Sense`: `how the information is input`
- `Think`: `how the information is processed`
- `Act`: `how/what will the robot do?`

 
## Components of Robotics
- Processor: Embedded PC, CPU, FPGA, Microco troller, etc.
- Algorithm: Localization, Path-Planning, Trajectory motion, Neuron-Fuzzy, etc.

**SLAM**
(Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

SLAM is a method used for autonomous vehicles that lets you build a map and localize your vehicle in that map at the same time. SLAM algorithms allow the vehicle to map out unknown environments. Engineers use the map information to carry out tasks such as path planning and obstacle avoidance.

*Control: Driver, Amplify, SSD, Relay, Motion control, PID, Fuzzy-PID, etc.

**Open-loop Control System**

An open-loop control system is simply a condition on a functioning machine whereby the system has two basic states: “On” or “Off.” The machine will stay On/Off for as long as the operator leaves it in that mode.

**Closed-loop Control System**

A closed-loop controller or feedback controller is a control loop which incorporates feedback, in contrast to an open-loop controller or non-feedback controller.
* Electronics: Transistor, Power MOSFET, Interfacing Circuit, Electronic Drivers etc.
* Mechanism: Robot platform, Gearhead, Actuators, Power Transmission, Belt, Chain, etc.
* Sensing: Vision System, Laser, Scanner, Gyro, Compass, Environment Sensors, etc.

## Fixed Robot

Stationary robots stay in one place but are usually equipped with an articulated limb for sorting or palletization. Rail-guided robots use rails, wires or magnetic tape to guide themselves from place to place. These robots aren't highly autonomous and are typically used as transportation systems.

**Cartesian Robot**

A cartesian robot system that uses XYZ coordinates to move multiple axes—typically three—to a specific location within its workspace. Cartesian robots can be extremely beneficial for engineers that are looking to automate their warehouses, improve their current systems, or solve unique design challenges.

**Cylindrical Robot**

Cylindrical Robots use a coordinate system, with three dimensions that use a selected reference axis and relative distances from it, for specifying point positions. Point positions are also specified by using the distance to a selected reference direction and the axis’ relative direction, and by the distance to the axis perpendicular to a selected reference plane.

_Some applications of cylindrical robots include_:
- Spot welding automation
- Robotic casting and molding machine handling
- General machine handling applications
- Material handling applications including package assembly and palletizing
- Robotic coating and finishing applications
- Automated assembly operations

**Parallel Robot**

A parallel manipulator is a mechanical system that uses several computer-controlled serial chains to support a single platform. Usually used for transporting items/objects.

**Spine Robot**

Usually used in medical field.

**Articulated Arm Robot**

Articulated robotic arms work on axis points, much like the human arm moves at the joints. However, a robot arm has much more flexibility than the shoulder, elbow, and wrist.
Articulated robots are widely used in manufacturing industries for tasks such as assembly, welding, painting, packaging, and material handling. These robots can perform these tasks with high precision and speed, resulting in increased productivity and efficiency.

**Intelligent Mobility Control** -> BostonDynamics

AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle)

An automated guided vehicle, different from an autonomous mobile robot, is a portable robot that follows along marked long lines or wires on the floor, or uses radio waves, vision cameras, magnets, or lasers for navigation.
Mostly used for logistics (Moving products etc.).
